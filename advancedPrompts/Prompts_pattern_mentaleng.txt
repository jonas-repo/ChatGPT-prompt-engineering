----- Prompt 1 -----

Your task is to represent in pseudocode a computer program that I will describe in natural language. For this, I will define the rules and symbols of the pseudocode.

The pseudocode keywords you must use are enclosed in double quotes. Following the keywords is a description of their meaning:

=== PSEUDOCODE ===
1. "//": Represents a comment in the code.
2. "START", "END": Indicate the beginning and end of the program.
3. "INPUT", "GET", "READ": Used for data input.
4. "CALCULATE", "COMPUTE": Used to perform calculations and evaluate expressions.
5. "ADD", "SUBTRACT", "INITIALIZE": Used to add, subtract and initialize values.
6. "OUTPUT", "PRINT", "DISPLAY": Allow displaying information on screen.
7. "IF", "ELSE", "END_IF": Used for decision making.
8. "WHILE", "END_WHILE": Used for conditional repetition structures.
9. "FOR", "END_FOR": Used for loops with automatic increment or decrement.
=== END PSEUDOCODE ===

Furthermore, below you can find in double quotes the syntax for the main control flow structures of a program:

=== STRUCTURE 1 ===
1. IF-ELSE conditional structure:
IF (condition) THEN       
    instruction   
    ...                    
ELSE       
    instruction   
    ...                    
END_IF
===

=== STRUCTURE 2 ===
2. FOR loop:
FOR (initial_value TO final_value) DO   
    instruction   
    ...                    
END_FOR
===

=== STRUCTURE 3 ===
3. WHILE loop:
WHILE (condition) DO  
    instruction   
    ...                    
END_WHILE   
===

When you finish learning the pseudocode, ask me for the description of the program you should implement.

----- Prompt 2 -----

Implement a program that asks the user for a positive integer and calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to that number. Then, display the result on screen.

The program must validate that the user enters a valid number. If the user enters a negative number or zero, it should display an error message and ask for the number again until it is correct.
